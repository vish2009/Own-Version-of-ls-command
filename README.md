# Own-Version-of-ls-command
Created my own version of ls command in Linux

In Linux All the commands are executables of C programs.
So we can also make custom commands to use.

The following code of ls.c is one such attempt.

To see the output 

use 
./ls ~/Desktop

Directory path should follow the ./ls to run successfully

Thnak you.
